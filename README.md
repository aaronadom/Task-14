# Task-14
HyperionDev - Defining Functions Holiday Project

A holiday program that calculates the flight, hotel and car rental costs of their holiday.

The user first inputs the city they are flying to, then the number of nights they will be staying at the hotel and finally the amount of days they will be renting a car.

The next four functions calculate the HOTEL COST, PLANE COST, CAR RENTAL COST and the overall HOLIDAY COST.
